Hello guys!

Raluca here, I'm a creative person, passionate about innovation and personal development, always looking for the next challenge.
This is why, after several years in the chemical field, I decided that I want to try something new: IT application development.
I'm a fast learner and I'm looking for a position which will help me grow in the IT field and also as a human.
